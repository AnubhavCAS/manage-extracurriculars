# **Notes**

- This was a part of my short-term experience (Creativity and Service) for the International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme.
- I do not collect any data, you can compile this yourself to check.
- The code gets really messy in some places, this is my fault that I did not plan it out properly. I will be trying to improve it in future if I can.
